                <li><strong>1920</strong> -  Married Grace Wahu, under Kikuyu customs. When Grace got pregnant, his church elders ordered him to get married before a European magistrate, and undertake the appropriate church rites.</li>

The paper, supported by an Asian-owned printing press, had a mild and unassuming tone, and was tolerated by the colonial government and also made a presentation on Kikuyu land problems before the Hilton Young Commission in Nairobi.</li>
                <li><strong>1929</strong> - KCA sent Kenyatta to London to lobby on its behalf with regard to Kikuyu tribal land affairs. Using the name Johnstone Kenyatta, he published articles and letters to the editor in The Times and the Manchester Guardian.</li>

The name "Jomo" is translated in English to "Burning Spear", while the name "Kenyatta" was said[by whom?] to be a reference to the beaded Masai belt he wore, and later to "the Light of Kenya".
